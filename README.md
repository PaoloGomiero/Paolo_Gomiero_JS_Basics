## Counter Application ##

### Location ###
The application is available at the following link: [counter](https://counterpaologomiero.netlify.app/).

### Site functioning ###
This project I propose is a simple counter, created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Once the webpage is open, you'll find a main counter, 
indicating the current value, followed by three buttons. The + button will increase the counter of one unity, the - will decrease it. The reset button will restart the cpunt from 0.

### HTML ###
The site structure has been created with HTML. I wanted the reset button to look at the opposite of the + and -, that's why I included some inline commands to style it.

### CSS ###
For the style, I studied the best colors combination, and finally choose a navy blue & orange. This choice keeps a good style standard while providing the project 
with a taste of game, which was my goal in the end. The chosen fonts are also aimed to give an impression of playful application.

### JavaScript ###
For the deployment of the application, I've created three different funtions that have been associated to each button. This gave me a sense of order in the creation of the project.
